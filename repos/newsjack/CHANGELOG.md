# Changelog

All notable Newsjack changes are documented here. **The release workflow
refuses to publish a tag that has no entry in this file** — add your notes
before pushing the tag.

How it works:

- Land user-visible changes with a bullet under `## Unreleased`.
- **Stable tag (`vX.Y.Z`)**: rename `Unreleased` to `## vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD`
  (and start a fresh empty `Unreleased` above it) before tagging. The
  workflow fails the release if the tag has no section.
- **Prerelease tag (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N`)**: no extra ceremony — the workflow uses
  the non-empty `Unreleased` section (or an exact tag section if you write
  one).

The published GitHub Release appends the auto-generated list of merged PRs
below these notes.

## Unreleased

## v0.1.19 — 2026-09-18

### Added

- `newsjack coarse-filter --engine jev` runs the detector's coarse-relevance pass through Jev (TypeSafe AI's typed-decision model) and writes the same `coarse_relevance_decisions.json` that `filter-apply` already consumes. Opt-in: configure a key with `newsjack auth set-typesafe --key <key>` (or `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`); `doctor` and `auth status` report it. The LLM worker path stays the default. The `relevance-coarse-filter` skill and the detector's harness routing describe when to use it.

## v0.1.18 — 2026-09-14

### Changed

- **The recommended monitor cadence now runs at 7am and 2pm.** Moving the
  morning scan from 8am to 7am helps scheduled agent runs avoid Anthropic's
  peak hours while preserving the early-afternoon follow-up. The once-daily
  recommendation now runs at 7am for the same reason.

## v0.1.17 — 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Opt-in Slack delivery for completed monitor reports.** Monitor setup can now connect a Slack incoming webhook and defaults to every-run notifications so users can see and tune early alert behavior; pitch-ready-only remains the quieter option. The detector writes compact Slack-ready copy only after the canonical report is finished, while the CLI keeps the webhook in a separate owner-only file, validates Slack hosts, refuses redirects, and records per-run sent markers to prevent routine duplicate posts. Older CLIs and skills continue to run without delivery.
- **Agent-driven media list research with incremental results.** The CLI now exposes only the two hosted-list operations agents need: `media-lists create` starts Medialyst's asynchronous campaign workflow after explicit credit approval, and `media-lists job --include-results` reads progress and normalized journalist rows while enrichment is still running. Stable idempotency keys prevent accidental duplicate jobs; the old spreadsheet CRUD/action surface remains removed.
- **Approval-gated list handoffs in detector reports.** Every pitch-ready opportunity now includes a URL-encoded Medialyst campaign link. It prepares a media-list plan for review and spends no credits until the user approves it in Medialyst; scheduled detectors never call the paid creation API themselves.

### Changed

- **`find-journalists` now prefers Medialyst's asynchronous research workflow when available.** The agent prepares the brief, sizes the research pool at 5x the desired good-fit count (up to 10x for constrained briefs), obtains explicit approval for that target and credit exposure, starts one job, polls it, and surfaces journalists incrementally before applying Newsjack's fit and anti-spam judgment. The CLI never applies a hidden multiplier. Medialyst remains optional and the local best-effort path remains available.

### Fixed

- npm package verification now accepts both the array output used by npm 10 and
  the package-keyed object output used by npm 12 for `npm pack --json`, keeping
  release publication compatible with the workflow's latest npm CLI.

## v0.1.16 — 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- **Claude.ai marketplace sync no longer treats the source-checkout CLI shim as
  a hosted plugin executable.** The marketplace now packages the dedicated
  `plugins/newsjack/` directory instead of the repository root, while keeping
  the canonical skills and Medialyst connector configuration shared with local
  installs. CI and the release workflow now reject any regression that would
  expose a top-level `bin/` through the hosted plugin package or reintroduce
  unsupported manifest metadata that Claude.ai would strip with a warning.

### Added

- **`build-ai-visibility-panel` turns any public URL and description into an
  evidence-bound prompt panel for AI-answer tracking.** Six composable atoms
  research ICPs and buyer jobs, design intent coverage across six prompt
  groups, generate blinded prompt variants, run contamination and duplicate QA,
  and produce a provisional measurement plan with explicit denominators,
  sources, gaps, and human approval gates. Reports name the groups the way a
  marketer would — Brand, Shortlist, Category, Problem, Goal, Market — and keep
  the `B0`–`B5` codes in the machine artifacts only. Synthetic fixtures and a
  ten-case public-URL eval exercise the workflow without private client data.

## v0.1.15 — 2026-06-30

### Added

- **`pr-calendar` now builds planned PR calendars from Medialyst's live PR
  calendar API.** The new skill pulls source-backed upcoming moments through
  `newsjack pr-calendar query` or the Medialyst MCP fallback, keeps only the
  moments where the brand has real standing, researches prior-year coverage
  patterns with `news-search`, and turns the result into a six-month,
  lead-time-aware plan.
- **The CLI now wraps `POST /api/v1/pr-calendar/query`.** Agents can query
  source-backed awareness days, seasonal hooks, conferences, retail moments,
  and cultural moments with convenience filters or an exact JSON API body.

### Changed

- **`find-journalists` now casts a wider research net before narrowing.** The
  skill separates two stages with opposite instincts — research wide (review on
  the order of ~100 articles/bylines across multiple queries, angles, regions,
  and outlet tiers to find ~10 real fits), then send tight — and clarifies that
  the anti-spam doctrine governs the send, not how widely you research. List
  size is now framed as an output of how many journalists genuinely fit, not a
  target to hit; the wave can be larger or smaller than 5-15 when the evidence
  says so.
- **`find-journalists` now self-audits for coverage gaps before returning.**
  A new step checks for obvious misses (unsearched regions/tiers, untried
  angles, competitor coverage, freelancers/newsletters, breaking coverage,
  unchased ambiguous bylines) and loops until a fresh round surfaces no new
  fits — coverage saturation — rather than stopping at a number. The summary
  now reports how wide the search went and where it stopped.
- **`find-journalists` now enriches the whole candidate pool in one call, then
  ranks.** The skill invites the user to enrich the entire on-topic pool — one
  enrich call takes up to 500 article URLs, so it passes the whole pool in a
  single call instead of hand-splitting batches. Enrichment returns each
  journalist's verified contact and recent articles, and that evidence is then
  ranked to set the send waves/tiers (enrich a lot, send few) rather than
  pre-narrowing to a few anchors before enriching.
- **`find-journalists` now teaches the "pull the thread" research method.**
  Instead of only firing queries thought up in advance, the skill searches a
  topic, reads the coverage, harvests the named entities and phrases inside it
  (people, companies, regulators, programs, events, quoted sources), and
  searches those in turn — repeating until new threads stop surfacing new
  coverage. This is how the non-obvious bylines, which usually sit two or three
  hops in, get found.

## v0.1.14 — 2026-06-24

### Changed

- `press-clip` now presents the outlet logo as a large centered trust signal
  above the clipped article instead of a metadata header band, and no longer
  highlights client mentions in whole-article clips.
- `press-clip` now supports `--root` as a runtime escape hatch for templates
  where the generic article-container heuristic picks the wrong element.

### Fixed

- `press-clip` now picks the article container by structure: the tightest
  candidate that holds the headline and most of the story text, excluding site
  chrome.
- `press-clip` now sweeps empty ad/embed placeholders left behind by blocked
  networks and forces a white print background to avoid trailing page bands.

## v0.1.13 — 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- `press-clip` now treats the outlet logo as a required trust signal: it tries
  the article masthead, then the outlet home page, then logo metadata, and
  reports where the logo came from so reviewers can catch text-only fallbacks.

## v0.1.12 — 2026-06-24

### Added

- **`press-clip` skill:** turn a live article URL into a branded press-clip
  PDF, preserving the outlet's logo and layout while stripping ads and
  clutter. This is local-agent only because it drives a real browser.
- **Medialyst OAuth device login:** `newsjack login` now guides local agents
  through a browser-based Medialyst authorization flow and stores refreshable
  credentials for news search and journalist enrichment.

### Changed

- README and getting-started docs now explain the AI-prompt setup path and
  show `press-clip` in the skills compatibility matrix.
- `find-journalists` and `news-search` copy now points agents toward the
  refreshed Medialyst public-API path.

### Fixed

- `press-clip` now closes its browser process even when clipping fails.

## v0.1.11 — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- **Medialyst now runs through the `newsjack` CLI's public-API wrapper instead
  of MCP.** The CLI calls Medialyst's public API directly; `find-journalists`
  and `news-search` use that path, with a local-artifact fallback when
  Medialyst is not configured. (#47)
- **`find-journalists` now treats `newsjack` as a news and enrichment data
  layer, not a hosted media-list manager.** Agents own list organization and
  final fit judgment; the final outreach list stays small and relevant, while
  larger candidate enrichment is allowed when screening multiple regions,
  angles, beats, or ambiguous bylines. (#48)
- The Claude plugin manifests (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `marketplace.json`) now track the release version; a release-workflow gate and
  a unit test keep them in sync with the tag.

### Removed

- The Medialyst MCP integration and its install-time setup, including the
  `NEWSJACK_INSTALL_MCP` option — no Node/MCP bridge is registered anymore.
  (#47)
- The `newsjack media-lists ...` command family. The CLI no longer creates,
  inspects, updates, shares, stores, or manages hosted media lists. (#48)

### Docs

- README: added a skills × harness compatibility matrix, reorganized setup by
  agent platform (local agents / Claude.ai & Cowork / ChatGPT), and clarified
  ChatGPT support (Skills beta for Business and Enterprise). (#46)
- Added Medialyst agent-native media-list and enrichment API handoff notes.
  (#48)

## v0.1.10 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Windows support (GA).** One PowerShell line installs Newsjack on a stock
  Windows 11 machine with no prerequisites — no install script, no git, no
  Node. The bare `newsjack.exe` bootstraps its own release bundle (checksum
  verified), installs skills, registers MCP, adds itself to the user PATH,
  and self-updates natively from then on.
- **Go-native Medialyst MCP bridge.** `newsjack mcp-bridge` speaks
  streamable HTTP to Medialyst directly, replacing `npx mcp-remote` — the
  Node dependency is gone on every platform. API keys still load at runtime
  and never land in harness config files.
- `headline-generator` skill: headline and subject-line candidates from a
  story's raw facts.
- Windows CI: unit tests, cross-compile gates, a full bootstrap battery,
  and a Windows job in the post-release smoke.

### Fixed

- All 13 findings from the first real-machine Windows install test,
  including: bootstrap now pins the bundle to the binary's own version;
  Claude Code is detected on Windows even when not on PATH;
  `install --source` adopts prebuilt bundles into the managed install;
  `mcp setup` repairs stale Medialyst registrations instead of skipping
  them; the documented install one-liner works on stock PowerShell 5.1.
- npm release verification no longer reports false failures from registry
  propagation lag.

### Changed

- New site logo (the `N_` mark).
