# Harness Routing & Chunking

The two coarse passes (relevance, story-origin) are low-cost tasks. They become low-cost *model* passes only when the harness supports model selection or low-cost worker/subagent routing. The artifact contracts (`coarse_relevance_decisions.json`, `origin_findings.json`) are the same regardless of harness — only the cost story changes, and that must be disclosed.

## Execution decision path

Before each coarse pass, identify the harness and take the first available path:

0. **Jev engine path (relevance pass only).** If `newsjack doctor` shows TypeSafe (Jev) configured, run the relevance pass with the CLI instead of worker fanout:

   ```bash
   newsjack coarse-filter --engine jev --candidates candidates.json --output coarse_relevance_decisions.json
   ```

   The output is the same decisions contract; feed it to `filter-apply` unchanged. No chunking is needed, the CLI runs the calls in parallel. Disclose `coarse relevance pass: jev` in the final response and include the `engine` block's call count, token count, and estimated cost from the decisions file. If the command exits non-zero (more than a fifth of calls failed), fall through to the paths below for this run and say so. The story-origin pass never uses Jev: it needs retrieval and prose evidence.

1. **Direct low-cost-model path.** If the harness can choose a model for a single step, run the coarse prompt with the lowest-cost reliable model below, then run the expensive pass with the strong model.
2. **Low-cost subagent/worker path.** If the harness can't switch the current model but can spawn workers/subagents with a model hint, split candidates into chunks. Relevance workers return only `decisions`; origin workers return only `findings`. Merge each pass into its single JSON artifact.
3. **Current-model fallback.** If neither is possible, run the prompts with the current model and state explicitly in the final response: `coarse passes ran with current model; this was semantic multi-stage, not cost-optimized multi-stage`.

## Harness hints

- **Claude Code / Claude-style coding harnesses:** if a `Task`/subagent tool or model override exists, use it for chunks and request the latest Haiku/low-cost alias; use the latest Sonnet or Opus alias for the expensive pass. No control exposed → current-model fallback.
- **Codex:** if `spawn_agent` is available and model override is allowed, spawn workers with a low-reasoning small/fast model (`gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, or the newest GPT-5.x at low reasoning). Use `gpt-5.5` or the strongest Codex model at medium/high reasoning for the expensive pass. If override is not allowed, spawn default workers for parallelism or use fallback; disclose which.
- **OpenClaw:** prefer low-cost worker fanout. Low-cost: Gemini 3 Flash Preview, Claude Haiku/latest alias, or GPT-5.x low-reasoning. Expensive: Gemini 3 Pro Preview, Claude Sonnet/Opus latest, or GPT-5.5+ higher reasoning.
- **API harnesses:** call the configured low-cost model for coarse prompts, then the configured stronger model for the expensive rubric pass.
- **Unknown harness:** current-model fallback unless an explicit low-cost-model or worker mechanism is exposed.

## Preferred models

- **Coarse passes:** Gemini 3 Flash Preview, Claude Haiku/latest Haiku alias, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5.4-mini low reasoning, GPT-5.5 low reasoning, or the harness's lowest-cost fast equivalent.
- **Expensive pass:** Gemini 3 Pro Preview, Claude Sonnet/Opus latest aliases, GPT-5.5 medium/high reasoning, GPT-5.4 medium/high reasoning, or the harness's strongest reasoning model.
- Treat Gemini 2.5 Pro as stale for this pipeline — fallback only when Gemini 3 Pro is unavailable. Gemini 2.5 Flash/Flash-Lite are coarse-pass fallbacks when Gemini 3 Flash is unavailable.
- If the exact named model is unavailable, choose the closest current low-cost/fast model for pass 1 and the closest current strong reasoning model for pass 2.

## Chunking guidance

- 1–15 signals: one call per coarse pass is fine.
- 16–40 signals: split into chunks of 8–15. Prefer at least 2 workers/subagents when the harness exposes them.
- 41–80 signals: split into chunks of 8–12. Use worker/subagent fanout if available.
- More than 80 signals: do not ask one low-cost call or one subagent to process everything. Split into chunks of 8–12; if that would need more than 8 low-cost workers, tighten detector `--limit`, lane caps, or rerun by profile/source lane before filtering.
- Each chunk must include the profile context plus only its assigned signals. Each worker returns only items for its assigned signal IDs.
- The merged `coarse_relevance_decisions.json` and `origin_findings.json` must each contain exactly one item per input signal unless intentionally using `--allow-missing`.
- Do not let coarse workers perform the expensive rubric pass, compare across chunks, pick best bets, or write the final report.
- If the harness has low-cost workers but no model override, still split large sets for reliability and disclose that model cost was not optimized.
- The story-origin pass needs retrieval. If a low-cost worker cannot open pages or search the web, either give it extracted page/search evidence from the orchestrator or run that pass in the current harness with retrieval tools — do not let a worker return a story-identity verdict it had no evidence for.
