# Headless angle-set generator for the model round-robin study.
#
# Runs one Claude model (addressed by EXACT id, e.g. claude-sonnet-5,
# claude-sonnet-4-6) as a clean-context angle-generator and captures its markdown
# angle set to OUT_FILE. Mirror of judge.sh: the apparatus (generator role + the
# angle-generator skill + ETHICS + WHY-NOT-SPAM) is assembled into one
# self-contained prompt and piped to `claude -p` with ALL tools disabled, so the
# run is a pure, fact-bounded completion — no web, no outside knowledge, no
# permission prompts. The only variable across models is --model.
#
# Why exact ids and not the Workflow model alias: the alias resolves only coarse
# tiers ('sonnet' -> current Sonnet), so it can't address a specific prior Sonnet
# (4.6). Reused opus.md/fable.md keep their original apparatus; this script
# produces the two Sonnet sets on matched, deterministic footing.
#
# Usage:
#   generate.sh MODEL_ID UPDATE_FILE OUT_FILE
#
# Idempotent: if OUT_FILE already exists and is non-empty, it is left untouched
# (resumability). A failed/empty generation leaves no OUT_FILE so a rerun retries.
