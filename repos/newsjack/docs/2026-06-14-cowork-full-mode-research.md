# Cowork Full Mode: Runtime Research and Shipping Decision

Research note on whether Newsjack's Full Mode can run inside Claude Cowork.
It started as a feasibility study and ends as a decision record. Supersedes the
current launch stance that treats Cowork as Limited Mode only (see README
runtime table and `docs/2026-06-01-open-source-installation-distribution-spec.md`).

**Decision (TL;DR).** A full scheduled/persistent path inside Cowork is
*technically* possible — it is documented below as evidence — but it is a **P2:
deprioritized on bandwidth, not killed.** The risk and positioning notes below
explain why it is low-ROI to build now, not why it is wrong. In the meantime
Cowork inherits the same **on-demand** experience as claude.ai chat: every skill
runs in-session at full quality, nothing to install. Persistence and scheduling
already have good homes — **Claude Code (or any local agent)** and the
**cloud-hosted Medialyst experience** — so a Cowork-specific build is not on the
critical path. The one thing that *is* worth prioritizing outside the CLI is a
**native Medialyst account connector (P0)** — see
["P0" below](#p0-the-medialyst-account-connector). It is small, standards-based,
and improves browser and cloud-agent surfaces where a local CLI is unavailable.

The sections through "The Medialyst credential problem" are the evidence behind
that call. The reasoning for the call itself is in
["Why shipping the Cowork scheduled path is risky"](#why-shipping-the-cowork-scheduled-path-is-risky)
and the sections after it.

## Background: the original "can't persist" conclusion

We had classified Cowork as Limited Mode because the detector pipeline depends
on durable local state (monitor profiles, credentials, seen-state SQLite) and a
scheduler, and we assumed an ephemeral Cowork runtime could host none of it. The
spec and README accordingly tell skills: in Cowork, do not attempt a CLI
install; fall back to Limited Mode.

That conclusion turns out to be only half right. The persistence problem is real
but narrower than we thought, and a viable Full Mode path exists.

## What the Cowork runtime actually provides

### Scheduling — two flavors, both with CLI access

- **Cowork scheduled tasks** (`/schedule` in Cowork, or the Scheduled tasks
  page) run **locally in the same Linux VM** as regular Cowork tasks, with the
  same capabilities: bash, the Claude Code CLI inside the guest, npm/pip, and
  arbitrary runnable binaries. Limitation: they only fire while the machine is
  awake and the desktop app is open; missed runs are skipped and re-run when the
  app reopens.
- **Cloud routines** (`claude.ai/code/routines`, research preview) are **full
  Claude Code cloud sessions** on Anthropic infra: shell commands, a cached
  setup script for installing tools, env vars for secrets, configurable network
  (custom allowlist or Full), external connectors, and schedule/API/GitHub
  triggers.
  These keep running with the laptop closed, but clone a fresh repo each run and
  keep no local disk between runs.

So routines *do* have CLI access, contradicting our earlier assumption.

### Persistence — the working folder is the escape hatch

Each Cowork conversation gets a **fresh per-session VM home**
(`/sessions/<random-id>/...`). Even `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`, documented as
persistent, does not survive across conversations today (known bug,
anthropics/claude-code#51398). So home-dir-based state is genuinely ephemeral —
that part of our original read was correct.

**But the user-selected working folder is the real host disk, mounted into the
VM via VirtioFS.** Anything written there persists across conversations
indefinitely. This is the hook that makes Full Mode possible: put Newsjack's
state and binary on the mount, not in the VM home.

### Network — configurable, not hard-locked

Cowork has an "Allow network egress" setting (Package managers only / All
domains, plus custom domain entries). Caveat: several open bugs report the
allowlist not being enforced correctly on desktop
(anthropics/claude-code#30861, #51400), so **"All domains" is the only reliable
setting today** for reaching arbitrary RSS feeds and the X API.

### A lucky break from our own packaging

`npm i -g newsjack` bundles the Go binaries inside platform packages
(`newsjack-linux-x64` etc. as `optionalDependencies`, per
`scripts/build-npm-packages.mjs`) — it does **not** download from GitHub
Releases at install time. So the npm install path needs only
`registry.npmjs.org`, which is reachable even in the most restrictive
"Package managers only" network mode. No GitHub Releases egress required.

## Feasibility: the path that *would* enable Full Mode in Cowork

This section documents that the scheduled/persistent path is achievable, as the
evidence behind the decision above. It is **not** a build plan — see
["Why shipping the Cowork scheduled path is risky"](#why-shipping-the-cowork-scheduled-path-is-risky).

1. **Dedicated persistent working folder** (e.g. `~/Newsjack`) attached to every
   Cowork conversation and to the scheduled task.
2. **State on the mount:** set `NEWSJACK_HOME` (knob already exists in the Go
   CLI) to `<working folder>/.newsjack`. Credentials, monitor profiles, and
   seen-state SQLite then live on host disk and survive sessions. No Go changes.
3. **Binary on the mount:** first run does `npm i -g newsjack` (registry-only,
   works in the VM), then cache the linux binary into
   `<working folder>/.newsjack/bin/`. Later sessions run it straight from the
   mount — no network install at all. Use `NEWSJACK_INSTALL_SKILLS=0` since
   skills come from the plugin, not the CLI installer.
4. **Network egress → "All domains"** so RSS feeds and the X API are reachable
   for source ingestion.
5. **A Cowork scheduled task** pointed at that working folder, prompting the
   newsjack-detector skill — that is the recurring monitor.

This reuses existing env knobs (`NEWSJACK_HOME`, `NEWSJACK_INSTALL_SKILLS`) and
the existing npm packaging. No Go or distribution changes are required for the
scheduled-task path.

### Residual gap and the always-on variant

The one gap vs. native Claude Code is that Cowork scheduled tasks need the app
open. For true always-on, a **cloud routine** closes it: the cached setup script
installs newsjack with Full network access, and seen-state is persisted by
pushing to a small private state repo (or the Medialyst substrate), since cloud
runs clone fresh and keep no local disk between runs.

## Empirical checks required before changing product docs

1. **RSS egress on desktop.** Confirm the macOS egress proxy bug
   (anthropics/claude-code#30861) does not block RSS fetching even on
   "All domains". If it does, source ingestion is degraded regardless of the
   rest of the path.
2. **SQLite over VirtioFS.** Confirm the seen-state SQLite store behaves over the
   VirtioFS mount — file locking can be flaky on shared filesystems. Low risk for
   the single-writer scheduled-task case, but verify before documenting.

## The Medialyst credential problem

The persistence path above moves Newsjack's *own* state (profiles, seen-state,
the binary) onto the host mount. But the live news-search source, hosted media
lists, and enrichment depend on a **Medialyst credential**, and that credential
has its own placement problem that the working-folder trick does not fully
solve for the cloud case.

### How Medialyst auth works today

- Medialyst auth is a **static per-user API key** (`mlst_…`) used as a Bearer
  token. Each user gets their own key from
  `medialyst.ai/agents` (300 free credits, then paid), so usage is billed per
  account.
- The key is stored locally in `~/.newsjack/credentials.json` (or
  `MEDIALYST_API_KEY` env / `.env`), per `apps/cli/cmd/newsjack/auth.go`.
- The `newsjack` CLI calls Medialyst's public REST API directly and attaches
  `Authorization: Bearer mlst_…` on each request. This is the supported Full
  Mode path for local agents.

### Can Medialyst be a native claude.ai connector? Not today.

Probing the live endpoint, it *advertises* OAuth:

```
www-authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token",
  resource_metadata="https://medialyst.ai/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"
```

…but that advertised discovery URL **returns 404** (as do the
authorization-server metadata variants). So the OAuth challenge header is
cosmetic — the actual authorization-server flow a claude.ai remote connector
needs is not served. Medialyst is a static-token resource, full stop.

### What this means per surface

| Surface | Works? | Where the key lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cowork scheduled task** (local VM) | Yes | `newsjack` CLI is present (per the path above) -> bridge loads the key from `credentials.json` on the persistent working folder (`NEWSJACK_HOME` on the mount). No extra mechanism. |
| **Cloud routine** (Anthropic cloud) | Only via env-var secret | No local key store survives between runs and Medialyst isn't a connector, so `MEDIALYST_API_KEY` goes in the routine's environment-variable secret store; the setup script installs `newsjack` and the bridge picks it up. Manual, per-user paste. |
| **Native claude.ai connector** (cleanest) | No | Requires Medialyst to ship a working OAuth flow (serve the resource-metadata + authorization-server docs). This is a Medialyst-side change, not a Newsjack one — and not in this repo (`apps/site` here is the `newsjack.sh` install site, not the Medialyst backend). |

So the working-folder path closes the **Cowork scheduled-task** case cleanly: the
Medialyst key rides along on the same persistent mount as the rest of
`NEWSJACK_HOME`. The residual gap is the **always-on cloud-routine** case, where
the key must be hand-entered as a routine env secret until Medialyst implements
OAuth.

Highest-leverage fix: if Medialyst served the OAuth protected-resource flow it
already half-advertises, it becomes a one-click claude.ai connector and the
entire Cowork/cloud-routine key problem disappears — connector traffic routes
through Anthropic and no local key store is needed. That work lives in the
Medialyst codebase, not here.

## Why shipping the Cowork scheduled path is risky

The feasibility path demos well, but standing it up as a *supported* product
surface carries cost and risk that the on-demand framing avoids entirely. This is
the case for leaving it at **P2**:

- **External egress bugs we don't control.** The desktop egress proxy has open
  reports of not enforcing the allowlist correctly even on "All domains"
  (anthropics/claude-code#30861, #51400). Direct RSS ingestion rides on that
  proxy, so a core data source depends on someone else's bug tracker. We can't
  commit to reliability we don't own.
- **App-must-be-open scheduling.** Cowork scheduled tasks only fire while the
  machine is awake and the desktop app is open. A monitor that silently skips
  runs is worse than no monitor — it erodes trust in freshness.
- **Working-folder discipline.** The whole path hinges on the user attaching the
  same persistent folder to every conversation *and* the scheduled task. Miss it
  once and that session has no state. That is a support-ticket generator.
- **VirtioFS SQLite is unverified.** Seen-state is SQLite; file locking over a
  shared VirtioFS mount can be flaky. Low risk for the single-writer case, but
  unproven, and corruption of seen-state shows up as missed or duplicate alerts.
- **Per-session binary re-bootstrap.** The VM home is ephemeral, so the path
  leans on caching the binary to the mount and re-resolving it each session.
  More moving parts to keep working as Cowork's VM internals change underneath us.
- **X token still needs manual placement.** X is a direct API call, not a
  connector, so even with the Medialyst OAuth win the user still hand-places a
  token on the mount/env for the X trend source.
- **Positioning cost (the big one).** A free, local, scheduled monitor inside
  Cowork competes directly with the cloud-hosted Medialyst experience — the tier
  we actually want engaged users to graduate into — and it does so on Anthropic's
  least-reliable surface. Building it spends engineering effort to blur a clean
  product story.

None of these make the path *wrong* — they make it **low-ROI right now**, which
is why it sits at P2 rather than in the backlog as a committed build.

## Where each need is served

The clean three-surface story makes Cowork's role obvious without a special build:

| If you want… | Use… | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic, on-demand, no setup | claude.ai chat **or** Cowork | Both are container-backed and run every skill in-session at full quality through the Medialyst OAuth connector. |
| Scheduled runs + persistence, self-hosted | Claude Code or your own agent | Real local state (`~/.newsjack`) plus routines — the canonical Full Mode. |
| Full feature, zero setup, always-on | The cloud-hosted Medialyst experience | Persistence and scheduling live server-side; nothing to install, reachable from any surface. |

Cowork does not get its own tier — it **inherits the on-demand tier**. The middle
and bottom rows are already covered by Claude Code and Medialyst, which is exactly
why the Cowork-specific scheduled path is P2: it would duplicate, on a riskier
surface, capability two other surfaces already deliver.

## P0: the Medialyst account connector

The highest-leverage, lowest-cost finding in this whole investigation has nothing
to do with Cowork's plumbing: **ship a native Medialyst account connector for
browser and cloud-agent surfaces.** The local CLI path is now REST-first, so this
connector is about making no-local-shell environments productive without asking
users to copy API keys.

Why this is P0:

- **It helps the whole ecosystem, not just Newsjack.** A standards-based account
  connection can work in Claude chat, Cowork, and third-party cloud agents
  without a local key-injection helper.
- **It's a security win for users.** No copy-pasting long-lived `mlst_` API keys
  into `.env` files or routine secret stores. OAuth tokens are scoped, revocable,
  and never sit in plaintext config.
- **It removes setup friction everywhere.** A one-click "connect Medialyst" in
  the user's account replaces "get a key, run `newsjack login`, configure the
  local environment."
  This is the difference between on-demand chat/Cowork being a real experience
  and a degraded one — it is what turns the news-search, story-origin,
  fact-check, journalist-fit, and media-list skills from best-effort fallback
  into the full thing.
- **It is the only path to no-setup persistence for chat.** Connector traffic
  routes through the user's account, so a future cloud-hosted detector becomes
  reachable from a plain browser tab with nothing installed.

This work lives in the Medialyst codebase (a commercial cloud substrate), not in
this open-source repo — `apps/site` here is the `newsjack.sh` install site, not
the Medialyst backend. But it is the single change that most improves the
open-source skills' out-of-box experience, so it belongs at the top of the
cross-repo priority list. Medialyst stays **optional cloud substrate, not a
signup wall** (consistent with `docs/getting-started.md`); the connector just
makes the optional upgrade frictionless and standards-based.

## Repo changes this implies

**Now (low cost, supports the on-demand tier):**

- Update skill runtime-mode guidance: the detector/setup skills currently
  hard-code "Cowork → Limited Mode, never install." Reframe Cowork (and chat) as
  the **on-demand tier** — every skill runs in-session; the news/list skills
  light up once Medialyst is connected via OAuth. Point users who want scheduled,
  persistent monitoring to Claude Code or the cloud-hosted Medialyst experience.
- Update the README runtime table: Cowork is **on-demand (same as chat)**, not
  "Limited only" and not a Full Mode scheduled surface.

**Deferred (P2 — only if bandwidth and the positioning case change):**

- The workspace-store bootstrap (set `NEWSJACK_HOME` on the mount, npm install
  once, cache the binary) for a Cowork-local scheduled monitor, plus the two
  empirical checks (RSS egress on desktop, SQLite over VirtioFS). Documented in
  "Feasibility" above; not on the critical path.

Any future build must stay consistent with the Minimal Memory doctrine in
`AGENTS.md`: the only durable state introduced is the already-sanctioned set
(monitor profiles, credentials, schedules, seen/suppression data), relocated onto
a user-owned, inspectable, deletable working folder rather than a hidden VM home.
