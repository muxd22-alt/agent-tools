# Getting started with newsjack

This is the front door. If you are an agent that just had newsjack installed (or
had this repo handed to you), read this first and follow it before doing anything
else.

## Runtime modes

Newsjack is optimized for local-first agent harnesses. Full Mode needs shell
execution, filesystem storage, credentials, durable client profiles, JSON
artifacts, scheduled workflows, multi-agent orchestration, and cost-optimized
worker passes.

Use **Full Mode** in:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- OpenClaw
- Hermes

Use **Limited Mode** in browser or restricted chat environments:

- Claude.ai chat
- ChatGPT chat
- Claude Cowork

Limited Mode can do strategy, newsworthiness checks,
angles, pitch critique, journalist-fit reasoning, fact-checking from pasted or
searchable evidence, and best-effort manual news scans. It cannot run the
canonical detector, save monitors, schedule runs, keep seen-state, write local
artifacts, or use cost-optimized multi-agent passes.

## Install paths

Default Full Mode install:

```bash
curl -fsSL newsjack.sh | bash
```

Use npm only in a Full Mode harness when shell installers or GitHub Release
assets are blocked:

```bash
npm i -g newsjack
newsjack install
```

On Windows there is no `curl | bash`. When the user is on Windows, download and
run the setup binary instead (requires v0.1.10 or later):

```powershell
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; iwr https://github.com/elvisun/newsjack/releases/latest/download/newsjack_windows_amd64.exe -OutFile newsjack.exe; Unblock-File newsjack.exe; .\newsjack.exe setup
```

`newsjack setup` fetches the skills bundle, verifies its checksum, installs the
CLI to `%USERPROFILE%\.newsjack\bin`, and runs the same guided setup as
macOS/Linux — including installing Claude Code via its native Windows installer
if it is missing.

Skill instructions assume the command is available as `newsjack` only in Full
Mode. In Limited Mode, do not try to install the CLI inside chat; use the
Limited Mode workflow and label detector-style output as reduced coverage.

## For the agent: start slow

On first contact, **do not** dump the full skill list, and **do not**
announce missing API keys. Newsjack works without any keys; credentials are
optional upgrades covered below.

Instead, find out what the user is trying to do and take **one** concrete step.
Open with a short orientation and offer a few real starting points — not the whole
menu:

> Newsjack turns me into your PR operator. I can run Full Mode in Claude Code,
> Codex, OpenClaw, or Hermes, or Limited Mode in browser chat. Where do you want
> to start?
>
> 1. **See what newsjack can do** — a quick tour of the workflow
> 2. **Get a PR strategy** — figure out audience, positioning, and news pegs first
> 3. **Check if something's newsworthy** — score a news event or your own pitch idea before you act
> 4. **Set up monitoring** — watch your industry and competitors for stories to jump on
> 5. **Track coverage** — Google Alerts-style keyword alerts filtered for real features
> 6. **Find journalists** — build a small, fit-checked media list for a pitch
> 7. **Build an AI-visibility prompt panel** — research a URL and map the buyer prompts worth tracking

Then let the user pick and go one step at a time. Each starting point maps to a
skill:

| Starting point | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| See what newsjack can do | (brief tour — only expand the full skill list if asked) |
| Get a PR strategy | `pr-strategist` |
| Check if something's newsworthy | `newsworthiness-check` |
| Set up monitoring | `newsjack-monitor-setup` |
| Track coverage | `coverage-tracker-setup` |
| Find journalists | `find-journalists` |
| Build an AI-visibility prompt panel | `build-ai-visibility-panel` |

If the user already knows what they want ("draft a pitch", "is this newsworthy?",
"roast this"), skip the menu and route straight to the relevant skill.

## Dependencies — what they unlock, and what they cost

**You can do real work with none of these.** Newsjack's base workflow — strategy,
angles, fit-checks, drafts, voice, newsworthiness, and a local journalist-list artifact
— needs no signup and no keys. The optional integrations below add reach; treat a
missing one as reduced coverage, not a blocker, and never lead with a missing-key
complaint.

| Dependency | Unlocks | Without it | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Medialyst login** | live news search plus progressively enriched media-list research for a campaign | news search falls back to host web/browser search; journalist lists become best-effort local artifacts with no guessed contacts | 300 free credits on signup; media-list research uses normal Medialyst credits after explicit approval — [medialyst.ai/agents#pricing](https://medialyst.ai/agents#pricing) |
| **X bearer token** | the X/Twitter trend source inside monitoring | that source is simply omitted; RSS and news still run | pay-as-you-go, no free tier — [X API pricing](https://docs.x.com/x-api) |
| **Slack incoming webhook** | optional delivery of finished saved-monitor reports to a chosen channel | reports stay in the agent chat and local run folder | no Newsjack or Medialyst credits; Slack plan rules apply — [Slack webhook guide](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/) |

### Why Medialyst for news search

General web search is bad at news: it ranks for SEO over recency, paywalls or
buries primary coverage, and rarely exposes a reliable publication timestamp.
Medialyst is purpose-built for news and returns the outlet, author, `published_at`,
and canonical URL that downstream skills (`coverage-tracker`,
`story-origin-check`, `newsworthiness-check`, `find-journalists`,
`newsjack-detector`) depend on. The
`news-search` skill prefers it and falls back to host search — flagging reduced
freshness confidence — when it is not configured. It is optional cloud substrate,
not a signup wall.

## Setting up credentials (only when the user wants the upgrade)

- **Medialyst:** prefer `newsjack login` for interactive setup. The command
  prints a Medialyst approval link, opens it in the browser when possible, and
  stores OAuth credentials in `~/.newsjack/credentials.json`. Tell the user to
  open the link and approve `newsjack CLI`; do not ask non-technical users to
  paste API keys.
  API keys still work for CI and power users through `MEDIALYST_API_KEY` or
  `newsjack auth set-medialyst --key <mlst_...>`. The CLI calls the Medialyst
  public REST API directly for news search, journalist enrichment, and
  asynchronous media-list research. The agent must get explicit
  approval for the exact campaign prompt and calculated research target before
  starting a credit-bearing list job, then poll and show normalized rows
  incrementally. For N requested good fits, the skill normally recommends a
  5x research target and may increase toward 10x for a highly constrained brief;
  the CLI never applies that multiplier silently.
  Default scopes: `news:search media_lists:manage`.
- **X:** set `X_BEARER_TOKEN` (alias `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`). Newsjack calls the X
  API directly.
- **Slack:** configure this only while setting up a saved monitor. The
  `newsjack-monitor-setup` skill defaults to every completed scan while the
  alerts are being tuned; users can choose pitch-ready-only delivery or no
  Slack instead. Create a webhook using
  Slack's [incoming webhook guide](https://docs.slack.dev/messaging/sending-messages-using-incoming-webhooks/),
  then enter it directly into `newsjack monitor delivery set-slack <slug>`'s
  hidden prompt — never paste it into agent chat or put it in a command
  argument. Newsjack keeps it out of the public profile and report artifacts.

Only bring these up when the user reaches a step that benefits from them.
