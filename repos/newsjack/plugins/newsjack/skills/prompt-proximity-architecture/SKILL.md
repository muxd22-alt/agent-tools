# Prompt Proximity Architecture

Design the cells before writing the strings.

This skill inherits the ethical floor from `skills/ETHICS.md`. It enforces anti-hallucination and evidence-bound coverage. Anti-spray and human-send are not applicable.

## Inputs

Require:

- a measurement charter;
- approved `icp_hypotheses.json` and `buyer_jobs.json`;
- target run/review budget;
- required locales, surfaces, and lanes;
- any campaign partition and prior-panel constraints.

If the charter is provisional, design a provisional architecture and name the gaps. Reject a charter that says only “track AI visibility.”

## Keep dimensions independent

Each intent cell fixes:

- buyer job;
- information act;
- journey state;
- material constraints;
- persona or buying role;
- locale and language;
- prompt-proximity band;
- expected answer kind.

Add independent tags for evidence grade, partition, lane eligibility, turn form, and optional funnel. Do not make funnel the schema.

Use the supported acts `explain`, `diagnose`, `plan`, `generate`, `compare`, `recommend`, `verify`, `navigate`, `buy`, `implement`, and `troubleshoot`. Include only acts entailed by the job evidence.

Use journey states `problem_identification`, `exploration`, `requirements_building`, `supplier_selection`, `adoption`, and `post_purchase`.

## Assign proximity

| Band | Name | Structure | Default aided status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `B0_direct_brand_product` | Brand | Names target brand/product; asks about facts, fit, use, reputation, support, or implementation | `target_aided` |
| `B1_comparison_purchase` | Shortlist | Shortlist, recommendation, alternatives, pricing, requirements, or comparison | `unaided`; `competitor_aided` when only competitors are supplied; `target_aided` for a declared target-vs-competitor comparison |
| `B2_category` | Category | Names an accepted solution category, not the target | `category_aided` |
| `B3_problem_need` | Problem | Describes pain, risk, trigger, or constraint without category/target | `unaided` |
| `B4_job_goal` | Goal | Asks for progress/outcome without supplying a solution category | `unaided` |
| `B5_broad_discovery_story` | Market | Trend, event, regulation, practice, or narrative connected to the job | `unaided` |

Use the code in `prompt_architecture.json` and the name in every Markdown summary. The
band codes are labels for structurally different prompts, not points on a scale: do not
write "B4" in prose, do not order or average them, and do not describe one band as
further along than another. See "Display names" in
`../build-ai-visibility-panel/references/artifact-contracts.md`.

Bands and aided status are correlated by construction — Brand is always `target_aided`,
Category always `category_aided`, and Problem, Goal and Market are always `unaided`, so
only Shortlist splits. Report the two together rather than as if they were independent
findings, and do not present a band breakdown that merely restates the prompted split.

`campaign_exposed` is an independent flag. Never combine target-aided, competitor-aided, category-aided, unaided, or campaign-exposed cells in one denominator.

Because `aided_status` is single-valued, a B1 prompt naming both the target and
a competitor is `target_aided`; record the competitor stimulus in the
contamination exception and keep the cell in the aided partition. A B1 prompt
naming competitors but not the target is `competitor_aided`.

Do not assign funnel mechanically:

- B0 can be post-purchase, not BOFU.
- B3 can describe an urgent funded decision.
- B1 can be early exploration.
- `funnel` may be `null`.

B5 requires fresh dated public evidence and a decay/refresh rule.

The charter's product/capability perimeter is also a coverage dimension. For every named area, create at least one evidence-supported job/cell or a `coverage_gap` with an exclusion/waiver and the evidence needed. Never silently omit a named area.

## Allocate coverage

Cover every dimension that the evidence supports, not every Cartesian combination. Never generate a full persona × locale × act × constraint grid.

For a diagnostic default, target 30–48 unique unaided cells, two variants per cell, and three repeats per wave. For a standard panel, target 60–120 cells. Adjust to the user's budget and keep aided cells outside the unaided quota.

Stratify minimums and targets across:

- B0–B5 where evidence supports each band;
- job, journey, and information act;
- ICP/role and materially distinct locale;
- evidence grade/source type;
- core, rotating, sentinel, control, and aided partitions;
- closed-model, retrieval, consumer-surface, and campaign lanes.

Protect underrepresented but decision-relevant strata. Grade-D cells are rotating discovery until independently validated or explicitly promoted.

When the budget cannot meet required coverage, return an allocation conflict. Do not silently drop a band, role, locale, or control.

## Prohibit unsupported cells

Mark a cell prohibited when it:

- changes an informational need into a recommendation solely to elicit brands;
- introduces a category not supported by the job evidence;
- treats a competitor-named prompt as unaided;
- uses target/campaign copy outside the allowed aided lane;
- assumes translation is locale equivalence;
- derives a core cell from current AI answers or target pages;
- exceeds the declared sampling budget without a waiver.

## Output

Give a Markdown coverage summary first: required dimensions, planned counts, gaps, conflicts, and why each missing band is unsupported.

Then write `prompt_architecture.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "artifact_id": "architecture-<stable-slug>",
  "created_at": "RFC3339",
  "created_by": "declared agent or human",

    {

      "job_id": "job-001",

      "funnel": null,
      "persona_id": "role-001",
      "locale": "en-CA",
      "language": "en",
      "material_constraints": [],
      "expected_answer_kind": "diagnosis_and_options",
      "turn_form": "single_turn",
      "lane_eligibility": ["closed_model", "retrieval"],
      "partition": "core",
      "evidence_grade": "A",
      "target_variants": 2,
      "required": true,
      "reason_source_ids": ["source-001"]
    }
  ],
  "prohibited_cells": [],
  "allocation": {
    "core_cells": 36,
    "rotating_cells": 8,
    "sentinel_cells": 12,
    "control_cells": 0,
    "aided_cells": 6,
    "budget_status": "within_budget | conflict | waived"
  }
}
```

Before handoff, require every `cells[].job_id` and every `cells[].icp_ids[]` to resolve exactly. There is one authoritative field for each relationship. Never leave a stale ID and add a compensating alias such as `job_id_authoritative`; rewrite the cell or stop with an allocation/reference error.

## Handoff

Pass the architecture plus a target-free blind brief to `realistic-prompt-generation`. Keep the contamination register outside the generator's context.
