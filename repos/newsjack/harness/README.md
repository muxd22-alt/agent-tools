# Newsjack Agent Runtime Harness

This harness is for observing the real installer inside a disposable Linux
container. It intentionally does not contain a second product implementation.
The installer should always exercise the compiled `newsjack` binary and the
real runtime skill install paths.

## Build The Harness Image

From the repo root:

```bash
harness/scripts/build-image.sh --harness all
```

Preinstall only the harness CLIs needed for a scenario:

```bash
harness/scripts/build-image.sh --harness claude --image newsjack-agent-harness:claude
harness/scripts/build-image.sh --harness claude --harness openclaw --image newsjack-agent-harness:claude-openclaw
harness/scripts/build-image.sh --harness none --image newsjack-agent-harness:none
```

The equivalent raw Docker build arg is:

```bash
docker build \
  -f harness/Dockerfile \
  --build-arg NEWSJACK_HARNESS_RUNTIMES=claude,openclaw \
  -t newsjack-agent-harness:claude-openclaw \
  .
```

Open a shell with the repo mounted:

```bash
harness/scripts/docker-shell.sh --image newsjack-agent-harness:local
```

To load provider/API keys from the ignored local harness env file:

```bash
harness/scripts/docker-shell.sh \
  --image newsjack-agent-harness:local \
  --with-local-env
```

Inside the container, isolate runtime state:

```bash
export HOME=/tmp/newsjack-home
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$HOME/.cache"
export XDG_DATA_HOME="$HOME/.local/share"
export PATH="$HOME/.newsjack/bin:$PATH"
rm -rf "$HOME"
```

`curl | sh` runs in a child shell, so it cannot update the parent shell's
`PATH`. Keep the `PATH` export above in the interactive shell, or run the
binary by absolute path:

```bash
"$HOME/.newsjack/bin/newsjack" version
```

## Local Source Path

Use this when iterating on `install.sh`, skills, or the CLI before deploying.
The public installer no longer builds Go on user machines, so local source
installs must provide a compiled binary explicitly.

Inside the container:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/newsjack-build
(cd apps/cli && CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -buildvcs=false -o /tmp/newsjack-build/newsjack ./cmd/newsjack)

NEWSJACK_SOURCE_DIR=/repo \
NEWSJACK_CLI_BINARY=/tmp/newsjack-build/newsjack \
NEWSJACK_RUNTIMES=all \
NEWSJACK_INSTALL_MCP=1 \
sh ./install.sh

hash -r
command -v newsjack
file "$(command -v newsjack)"
newsjack version
newsjack setup
newsjack skills list
newsjack doctor | jq .
```

Expected:

- `file "$(command -v newsjack)"` reports an ELF executable, not a shell script.
- Skills land under the temp home runtime dirs, for example
  `$HOME/.agents/skills`, `$HOME/.claude/skills`, and `$HOME/.openclaw/skills`.
- MCP setup either configures detected runtimes or logs non-blocking warnings.

## Local Hosted-Dist Path

Use this to test the same shape as production before pushing: the site serves
`/install.sh` and `/dist`, and the container installs via HTTP.

For an interactive Codex-only install test where you manually run the
`curl | bash` command inside a clean container:

```bash
harness/scripts/open-codex-curl-shell.sh
```

The script builds a local release bundle from the current checkout, serves it on
localhost, and opens a container with Codex preinstalled. It prints the exact
installer command to run inside the container. In an interactive container, the
installer should hand off to `newsjack setup` automatically. Set
`NEWSJACK_RUN_SETUP=0` on the installer command for install-only debugging.

To test the first-run user experience with Codex installed but no repo `.env`,
no mounted source checkout, and no API-key environment variables:

```bash
harness/scripts/open-codex-curl-shell.sh --clean-no-env
```

On the host, from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/site run build
pnpm --dir apps/site exec next start --port 3010
```

In another terminal, start the harness container. On Docker Desktop for macOS,
the host is reachable as `host.docker.internal`:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/repo" \
  -w /repo \
  newsjack-agent-harness:local \
  bash
```

Inside the container:

```bash
export HOME=/tmp/newsjack-home
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$HOME/.cache"
export XDG_DATA_HOME="$HOME/.local/share"
export PATH="$HOME/.newsjack/bin:$PATH"
rm -rf "$HOME"

curl -fsSL http://host.docker.internal:3010 | \
  NEWSJACK_DIST_BASE=http://host.docker.internal:3010/dist \
  NEWSJACK_RUNTIMES=all \
  NEWSJACK_INSTALL_MCP=1 \
  sh

hash -r
file "$(command -v newsjack)"
newsjack version
newsjack setup
newsjack doctor | jq .
```

On Linux hosts, add Docker's host gateway mapping when starting the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -v "$PWD:/repo" \
  -w /repo \
  newsjack-agent-harness:local \
  bash
```

## Production Path

Use this after a push/deploy to verify the live domain end to end:

```bash
export HOME=/tmp/newsjack-home
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="$HOME/.cache"
export XDG_DATA_HOME="$HOME/.local/share"
export PATH="$HOME/.newsjack/bin:$PATH"
rm -rf "$HOME"

curl -fsSL newsjack.sh | \
  NEWSJACK_RUNTIMES=all \
  NEWSJACK_INSTALL_MCP=1 \
  sh

hash -r
command -v newsjack
file "$(command -v newsjack)"
newsjack version
newsjack setup
newsjack skills list
newsjack doctor | jq .
```

To inspect the deployed channel:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://newsjack.sh/dist/channels/main.txt
curl -fsSL https://newsjack.sh/dist/manifest.json | jq .
```

Scripted production smoke with local credentials:

```bash
harness/scripts/run-ci-installer.sh \
  --image newsjack-agent-harness:all \
  --runtime all \
  --production-path \
  --with-local-env
```

`--with-local-env` loads `harness/.env.local` into the container with Docker's
`--env-file`. The script validates that repo-local env files are ignored by git
and never prints secret values. CI should keep using the default no-token path.

## Jev Coarse-Filter Shell

One command opens a disposable container with the branch's CLI built and
installed into an isolated home, the TypeSafe key saved from
`harness/.env.local`, auto-update disabled so the hosted channel cannot replace
the branch binary, and a printed cheat sheet of test commands from unit tests
up to the live agreement eval:

```bash
harness/scripts/open-jev-shell.sh            # builds newsjack-agent-harness:jev if missing
harness/scripts/open-jev-shell.sh --rebuild  # force an image rebuild
```

`harness/.env.local` needs `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`; `MEDIALYST_API_KEY` and
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are optional (the latter lets you run the detector skill in
Claude Code inside the container). The chunk and eval commands on the cheat
sheet expect the 2026-06-03 fixture runs under
`fixtures/newsjack-detector-agent/runs/` (local, not committed). The setup
itself is `harness/scripts/jev-container-setup.sh`; re-source it inside the
container after editing Go code to rebuild and reinstall.

## Model Eval Scenarios

Manual model/runtime dogfood scenarios live in
[`harness/eval-scenarios.md`](eval-scenarios.md). They are prompts plus
expected behavior, not a prescribed runner. The agent or reviewer running an
eval owns the harness, model, mock services, and transcript assertions.

## Native MCP Bridge Smoke (no credentials)

`newsjack mcp-bridge` is a native Go stdio-to-streamable-HTTP proxy; it needs
no Node/npx on the machine. The CI battery proves this against
`harness/mock-mcp`, a tiny mock Medialyst MCP server:

```bash
(cd harness/mock-mcp && go run . --addr 127.0.0.1:8970 --key mock-key) &
printf '%s\n' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"smoke","version":"0"}}}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}' \
  '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list"}' | \
  MEDIALYST_API_KEY=mock-key \
  NEWSJACK_MEDIALYST_MCP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8970/mcp \
  newsjack mcp-bridge
```

Expected: the initialize result and a `mock_search` tool listing on stdout,
exit 0. The same override env var points the bridge at any compatible
endpoint for debugging.

## Live Medialyst MCP Check

Use this only when you intentionally want to spend Medialyst credits. It runs one
clean container per runtime, installs from a sanitized local source bundle with
the repo `.mcp.json` removed, runs `newsjack setup` from `/tmp`, saves the
Medialyst key from setup input, checks that the selected runtime got a
`medialyst` MCP entry, then runs one live `news_search` query without
`MEDIALYST_API_KEY` in the command environment.

```bash
harness/scripts/run-live-medialyst-mcp.sh \
  --image newsjack-agent-harness:all \
  --with-local-env
```

To narrow the run:

```bash
harness/scripts/run-live-medialyst-mcp.sh --runtime claude --with-local-env
```

Implementation detail: the runtime MCP config should contain only the bridge
command, not the API key. The bridge is `newsjack mcp-bridge`; it reads
`~/.newsjack/credentials.json` or `MEDIALYST_API_KEY` and passes the bearer token
to Medialyst when the MCP server starts. Claude Code is verified through its
special user-scoped `claude mcp add-json --scope user` setup path.

## Auto-Update Observation

Installed binaries auto-update from the hosted `main` channel before normal
user-facing commands. To force that path in the container:

```bash
printf 'stale-version\n' > "$HOME/.newsjack/newsjack/VERSION"
newsjack doctor > /tmp/newsjack-doctor.json 2> /tmp/newsjack-update.log

cat /tmp/newsjack-update.log
jq . /tmp/newsjack-doctor.json
cat "$HOME/.newsjack/newsjack/VERSION"
```

Expected:

- stderr shows `[info] auto-updating ...`.
- stdout remains valid JSON for `doctor`.
- `VERSION` is rewritten to the live channel commit.

Disable auto-update for deterministic debugging:

```bash
NEWSJACK_AUTO_UPDATE=0 newsjack doctor | jq .
```

## Notes

- Put installer environment variables on the `sh` side of the pipe:
  `curl -fsSL newsjack.sh | NEWSJACK_RUNTIMES=all sh`.
- Do not use `NEWSJACK_RUNTIMES=all curl ... | sh`; that only sets the
  variable for `curl`, not for the installer shell.
- The old `harness/run.py` workflow is gone. If a scripted harness returns,
  keep it as a thin shell or Go wrapper around these commands and the compiled
  `newsjack` binary.
